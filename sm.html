                    Brand identity and collateral design for StrongMinds, a nonprofit that provides group talk therapy to women in Africa so they can alleviate depression and lift themselves out of poverty. StrongMinds' model is designed to treat depression rapidly, cost-effectively, and at scale. The organization needed a brand refresh that was authentic in order to speak to their female patients, as well as professional to attract the investor community.
                </p>
                <p>Drawing from the brush stroke line and letter "i" of the original logo, the graphic elements are reminiscent of a community coming together, just as StrongMinds' talk therapy helps women heal through their collective strength. The custom icons of African women's profiles are used to help the brand communicate a more human, authentic tone. </p>
