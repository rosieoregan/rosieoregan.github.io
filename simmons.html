                <p>
                    Simmons Bedding Company is a 150 year-old American mattress manufacturer, founded in 1870, who sought to shed its heritage and re-launch amongst a group of consumers unfamiliar with its flagship brand, Beautyrest: Generation Z. In 2019, Simmons was in need of someone to reimagine its logo and set the tone for its new brand identity. I was contracted by <a href="https://www.burnsgroupnyc.com/">Burns Group</a>, a branding and advertising agency based in Manhattan, to concept and design a new logo in one week to prepare the company for a supplier pitch. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are the initial sketches and logo exploration. The final logo features a winking eye with long lashes that forms the ‘O’ of the word mark. The Burns Group’s creative team ran with the logo and built the brand identity, tone of voice, and packaging and communication design around its playful elements. <a href="https://www.simmons.com/">Simmons Mattresses</a> will be launching in stores and online in 2020.
