                <p>
                    Months into the pandemic, General Assembly launched a campaign to increase awareness of the company's expertise in online learning. In contrast to competitors who scrambled to move all in-person learning to an online format, GA offered its first online course over 4 years ago. In addiion to digital advertising, the marketing team sought to create an immersive lander that would showcase the actual experience of being an online student. I led the concepting of the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/online-learning-experience/">Online Learning lander</a> to highlight that students would still have access to experienced instructors, career coaches, and a robust community online.   
                </p>
                <p>I partnered with the Video and Product Design team to concept how this lander would come to live and what we could achieve within the limitations of our platform. The page opens on a desktop setup; as the user scrolls videos are triggered to demonstrate the remote learning experience. The perspective shift of zooming in to each of these interfaces is meant for the user to feel like they are experiencing a day in the life of an online student.</p>
